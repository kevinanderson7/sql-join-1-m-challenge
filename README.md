## Setup

The dataset provided contains population data from the World Data Bank.

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Create a database named `world` using Postico.
3. Open terminal in this folder and run `psql world < world.sql` to import the data.
4. Hit `cmd r` in Positco and make sure the data import worked correctly.

## Assignment

Complete the questions in the `assignment.sql` file. Use Postico to test your SQL and copy your final answer into the `assignment.sql` file.


## Attribution

Data in the `world.sql` file is from the [World Data Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). Some of the aggregate rows from the data set have been removed due to redundancy. All data is from the year 2017.
